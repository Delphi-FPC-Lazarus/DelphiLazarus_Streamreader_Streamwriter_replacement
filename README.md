# DelphiLazarus_Streamreader_Streamwriter_replacement
Datagrid replacement class can replace Streamreader and Streamwriter for Delphi and Lazarus

## What it is  
Replacement class for Streamreader/Streamwriter
for reading/writing UTF8 text files

Streamreader has a huge disadvantage when loading:
If the file is damaged somewhere, i.e. contains a non utf8 decodeable character, the whole file is no longer readable at all.
With the assignfile with codepage and realn the file is readable, the unreadable character is replaced by the reserved Unicode character.
